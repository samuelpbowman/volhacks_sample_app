# Sample App for VolHacks preparation

Here I have spun up a simple application for Mike and I to practice working with Python's Django

### Preparation

After setting up and switching to your `virtualenv`, install the necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
I named mine "sample_venv", but you can name yours anything. Just be sure to add the venv's folder to the .gitignore!

### To Run

You will need to migrate the database before running (even though this application does not really use the database)
