# Sample App for VolHacks preparation

Here I have spun up a simple application for Mike and I to practice working with Python's Django

### Preparation

After setting up and switching to your `virtualenv`, install the necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### To Run

You will need to migrate the database before running (even though this application does not really use the database)
